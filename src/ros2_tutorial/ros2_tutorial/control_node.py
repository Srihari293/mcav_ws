# Next step: 
# 1. Once you have written the control node, go to your root workspace (~/(your_ws)) and build the workspace with the command (colcon build)
# 2. You will see build, log and an install folder along side your src folder
# 3. Additionally, in your ros2_tutorial path (/home/(USER))/(your_ws)/src/ros2_tutorial), you will find package.xml, setup.py, setup.cfg files and 
#    resources and test folders.
# 4. These are files that get created when we build a python workspace
